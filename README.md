# CF-SubDomains
Dynamically Create and/or Manage Subdomains in ColdFusion.

CF-Subdomains is a snippet of code (best used in your OnRequest Method of Application.cfc) to detect and include files
from a subdirectory on your server and let it act like a subdomain.

It uses a Database to confirm if the SubDomain is Valid.

Tested on ColdFusion 7+, Railo 4
